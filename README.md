# nodejs-angular2-webpack-seed

Seed project to start with a development environment for nodejs , angular 2 and webpack in vscode.

Development environment that is simple with just NPM. Skipped using gulp or grunt.Goal is to simply have a project environment with basic package.json and npm to start with a nodejs / angular2 project with webpack to bundle up the frontend. 

Visual studio code is a wonderful IDE so I also went with basic launch and debug scripts to start coding and debugging just by cloning this project.
